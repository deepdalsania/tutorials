''' Creating new instances of class objects can be a great way to keep track
    of values using attributes associated with the object. The values of
    these attributes can be easily changed at the object level. The following
    code illustrates a famous quote by George Bernard Shaw, using objects to
    represent people. Fill in the blanks to make the code satisfy the
    behavior described in the quote. '''


# “If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then
# you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have
# an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.”
# George Bernard Shaw

class Person:
    apples = 0
    ideas = 0


johanna = Person()
johanna.apples = 1
johanna.ideas = 1

martin = Person()
martin.apples = 2
martin.ideas = 1


def exchange_apples(you, me):
    # Here, despite G.B. Shaw's quote, our characters have started with       #different amounts of apples so we can better observe the results.
    # We're going to have Martin and Johanna exchange ALL their apples with #one another.
    # Hint: how would you switch values of variables,
    # so that "you" and "me" will exchange ALL their apples with one another?
    # Do you need a temporary variable to store one of the values?
    # You may need more than one line of code to do that, which is OK.
    you.apples, me.apples = me.apples, you.apples
    return you.apples, me.apples


def exchange_ideas(you, me):
    # "you" and "me" will share our ideas with one another.
    # What operations need to be performed, so that each object receives
    # the shared number of ideas?
    # Hint: how would you assign the total number of ideas to
    # each idea attribute? Do you need a temporary variable to store
    # the sum of ideas, or can you find another way?
    # Use as many lines of code as you need here.
    you.ideas, me.ideas = you.ideas + me.ideas, you.ideas + me.ideas
    return you.ideas, me.ideas
