When you went undercover in Commander Lambda's 
organization, you set up a coded messaging system with 
Bunny Headquarters to allow them to send you important 
mission updates. Now that you're here and promoted to 
Henchman, you need to make sure you can receive those 
messages - but since you need to sneak them past 
Commander Lambda's spies, it won't be easy!

Bunny HQ has secretly taken control of two of the 
galaxy's more obscure numbers stations, and will use 
them to broadcast lists of numbers. They've given you a
 numerical key, and their messages will be encrypted 
within the first sequence of numbers that adds up to 
that key within any given list of numbers.

Given a non-empty list of positive integers l and a 
target positive integer t, write a function solution(l,
 t) which verifies if there is at least one consecutive
 sequence of positive integers within the list l (i.e. 
a contiguous sub-list) that can be summed up to the 
given target positive integer t (the key) and returns 
the lexicographically smallest list containing the 
smallest start and end indexes where this sequence can 
be found, or returns the array [-1, -1] in the case 
that there is no such sequence (to throw off Lambda's 
spies, not all number broadcasts will contain a coded 
message).

For example, given the broadcast list l as [4, 3, 5, 7, 
8] and the key t as 12, the function solution(l, t) 
would return the list [0, 2] because the list l 
contains the sub-list [4, 3, 5] starting at index 0 and
 ending at index 2, for which 4 + 3 + 5 = 12, even 
though there is a shorter sequence that happens later 
in the list (5 + 7). On the other hand, given the list 
l as [1, 2, 3, 4] and the key t as 15, the function 
solution(l, t) would return [-1, -1] because there is 
no sub-list of list l that can be summed up to the 
given target value t = 15.

To help you identify the coded broadcasts, Bunny HQ has 
agreed to the following standards:

- Each list l will contain at least 1 element but never 
more than 100.
- Each element of l will be between 1 and 100.
- t will be a positive integer, not exceeding 250.
- The first element of the list l has index 0.
- For the list returned by solution(l, t), the start 
index must be equal or smaller than the end index.

Remember, to throw off Lambda's spies, Bunny HQ might 
include more than one contiguous sublist of a number 
broadcast that can be summed up to the key. You know 
that the message will always be hidden in the first 
sublist that sums up to the key, so solution(l, t) 
should only return that sublist.

Input:
solution.solution([1, 2, 3, 4], 15)
Output:
-1,-1
Input:
solution.solution([4, 3, 10, 2, 8], 12)
Output:
2,3
